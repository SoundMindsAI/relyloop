# feat_ubi_llm_study_comparison — side-by-side UBI-vs-LLM study comparison view

**Date:** 2026-05-30
**Status:** Idea — split out from `feat_demo_ubi_study_comparison` Phase 1 at finalization (PR #320)
**Priority:** P2
**Origin:** Deferred Phase 2 capability of [`feat_demo_ubi_study_comparison`](../../../implemented_features/2026_05_30_feat_demo_ubi_study_comparison/feature_spec.md) (Phase 1 merged via PR #320, 2026-05-30). Phase 1 shipped the *data* — dual judgment lists + dual (LLM)/(UBI) studies on three demo scenarios; this feature wraps the cross-tab manual comparison in a dedicated single-page view. Defined originally in that feature's `feature_spec.md` §3 "Phase boundaries" / "Out of scope (deferred to Phase 2)".
**Depends on:** `feat_demo_ubi_study_comparison` Phase 1 merged (synthetic UBI + dual studies in the demo dataset — **done**, PR #320). Independent of any other in-flight MVP2 feature.

## Problem

A demo operator who wants to compare the UBI-derived study against the
LLM-derived study on the same scenario must open both study detail pages
in two browser tabs and mentally diff:

- The digest narratives (different prose; different called-out queries).
- The best-trial parameter values (different operating points).
- The best-metric scalar (which path "won" on nDCG@10).
- The convergence curves (did UBI converge sooner?).

This works but is awkward, and the central value proposition of the
synthetic-UBI demo — "see what changes when you ground judgments in real
behavior instead of an LLM's rubric reading" — is buried behind manual
cross-tab labor. This feature wraps it into a single dedicated page.

## Proposed capabilities

### Side-by-side study comparison view

- New route `/studies/compare?a={study_a_id}&b={study_b_id}` (query-param
  driven so the URL is shareable / linkable from the digest pages).
- Layout: two-column responsive grid with a narrow center column for
  per-row diff highlights.
- Panels (top to bottom):
  1. Study header pair — name, status, judgment-list source (with the
     Phase-1 `Synthetic demo data` chip rendered correctly per
     `isDemoSyntheticUbiClusterName` gating).
  2. Digest narrative diff — render both narratives side-by-side; use
     `diff-match-patch` (or similar) to highlight added/removed sentences
     in the center column.
  3. Best-trial parameter table — column per study, row per parameter;
     center column flags identical values vs different values.
  4. Best-metric scalar comparison with delta annotation.
  5. Convergence-curve overlay (Recharts; two `<Line>` series on the
     same plot, alpha-blended so divergence is visible).
- Entry points: a "Compare with UBI list" button on the LLM study
  detail page (visible when a paired UBI study exists for the same
  query set) and vice versa.

### Cross-link from Phase 1 surfaces

- The Phase 1 dashboard studies table gains a "Compare ↔" affinity
  badge for study pairs from the same query set on a synthetic-UBI
  demo cluster.
- The Phase 1 `ValueDeltaCard` on the judgment-list detail page gains
  a "View matched study comparison" button when a paired study exists.

### Tutorial guide subsection

- [`docs/08_guides/tutorial-first-study.md`](../../../../08_guides/tutorial-first-study.md)
  Step 11 grows a "Compare LLM vs UBI on the same dataset" subsection
  with screenshots of the new comparison view.

## Also-deferred: UBI rung badge on the cluster-detail page

Phase 1's spec FR-7 surface #3 asked for the synthetic-data chip
"adjacent to the `<UbiRungBadge>`" on the cluster-detail page — but
`<UbiRungBadge>` does **not** render on `/clusters/[id]` today. Per its
component docstring
([`ui/src/components/clusters/ubi-rung-badge.tsx`](../../../../ui/src/components/clusters/ubi-rung-badge.tsx)),
the badge is consumed **only** inside the generate-judgments dialog
because the cluster-detail page lacks the `query_set_id` + `target`
context the readiness endpoint requires (a cycle-3 plan-review fix in
`feat_ubi_judgments`, `readiness-snapshot-badge-contract-drift`, removed
the context-free snapshot variant). Phase 1 therefore renders the chip
next to the cluster **name**; GPT-5.5's PR #320 review flagged the
placement mismatch and the root cause is the original spec assuming a
badge that no longer exists on that surface.

This feature (or a small standalone chore) should decide whether to
surface a rung badge on the cluster-detail page at all — it would need a
default query-set + target selection (or a "pick a query set to see UBI
readiness" affordance) so the readiness endpoint can be called with the
three required params. If/when that lands, move the chip adjacent to it
and correct the original spec's FR-7 #3 wording.

## Scope signals

- **Backend:** likely a single new endpoint `GET /api/v1/studies/compare?a={id}&b={id}` returning a pre-aggregated comparison payload (saves the frontend from doing two independent GETs and a third digest fetch). Reuses existing study + digest serializers; no new DB tables.
- **Frontend:** new route `/studies/compare`, new `<StudyComparisonPage>` component, new `useStudyComparison` hook in `ui/src/lib/api/studies.ts`, new diff utility module. Recharts adds one new chart variant (overlay). Cluster-detail rung badge (above) is frontend-only + a query-set/target selector.
- **Migration:** none.
- **Config:** none.
- **Audit events:** none (read-only view).

## Why deferred

Phase 1 ships the data and the existing per-judgment-list value-delta
card — enough for an operator who reads the tutorial to do the
comparison manually across two browser tabs. The dedicated comparison
view is **net-new frontend** (route + page + component + data hooks +
diff utility) that requires its own UX decisions (visual diff
algorithm, mobile/responsive layout, which panels are
progressive-disclosure vs always-visible).

Splitting Phase 2 out kept Phase 1's PR focused on the seed-side
plumbing (Python generator + reseed wiring + 5 disclaimer-chip
surfaces) and avoided mixing a substantial frontend feature into a
PR whose primary value is data infrastructure.

## Relationship to other work

- **Phase 1** (`feat_demo_ubi_study_comparison`, shipped) ships the dual
  lists + dual studies and the disclaimer chips. This feature consumes
  that data unchanged.
- **`feat_pr_metric_confidence`** (shipped — `study_confidence.py`)
  provides bootstrap CI / runner-up-gap data that the metric-comparison
  panel may surface to help operators interpret the LLM-vs-UBI delta
  beyond a single scalar.
- **`feat_digest_executable_followups`** (shipped) — the digest-diff
  panel renders both digests' suggested followups; if the two studies
  suggest divergent next steps that's a useful comparison signal in its
  own right.
- Independent of `chore_ubi_reader_search_after_pagination` and
  `chore_ubi_hybrid_template_render`.

## Open questions for /spec-gen

1. **Cluster-detail rung badge — in scope here, or a standalone chore?**
   **Recommended default: standalone chore (out of scope for this feature).** The rung-badge work needs its own UX decisions (query-set/target picker affordance, default-pick heuristic, where the badge sits in the cluster-detail layout) that don't share design surface with the side-by-side study comparison view. Spinning a separate `chore_cluster_detail_rung_badge` idea keeps this feature's PR scoped to "the comparison view" and unblocks shipping it without coupling to a placement-decision exercise. The originally-misplaced FR-7 #3 chip stays put under Phase 1's wording until the chore lands and moves it.

2. **Diff library — `diff-match-patch`, `diff-words`, or a hand-rolled sentence splitter?**
   **Recommended default: `diff` (the `jsdiff` library)** — it ships sentence-level `diffSentences()` which is exactly what the digest-narrative panel needs and avoids the prose-level word-by-word noise that `diff-match-patch` produces. Already in the npm ecosystem with permissive license; no native module. If the visual result is too coarse during implementation, fall back to `diffWordsWithSpace`. Hand-rolled is rejected — sentence detection is full of edge cases (abbreviations, ellipses, code blocks) that a maintained library handles.

3. **Pre-aggregated comparison endpoint shape — return both digests + both best-trials + both convergence curves in one payload, or return a thin "pairing" object and let the page fetch the two `/studies/{id}` payloads in parallel?**
   **Recommended default: thin pairing endpoint (`GET /api/v1/studies/compare?a={id}&b={id}`)** that validates the pair (same `query_set_id`, both `status='completed'`, one LLM judgment list + one UBI judgment list), returns the pair's metadata (`pair_kind`, validity warnings if any), and lets the page fetch the two existing `/studies/{id}` payloads via the existing TanStack Query cache (warm if the operator clicked from a detail page). Avoids duplicating the existing study-detail serializer, gets cache reuse for free, keeps the new endpoint single-purpose.

4. **What's the entry-point copy when the LLM study has no paired UBI study?**
   **Recommended default: hide the "Compare with UBI list" button entirely** (rather than disabled-with-tooltip). The button is a discovery affordance; surfacing it as disabled creates expectation friction on clusters that genuinely don't have UBI. The judgment-list "View matched study comparison" button behaves the same way.

5. **Mobile / narrow-viewport layout — stack panels vertically, or hide the comparison view below a min-width breakpoint with a "comparison requires a wider screen" message?**
   **Recommended default: stack vertically** (study A above study B, both above the per-row diff column rendered as inline annotations). Reachability matters more than visual parallelism on a phone; the digest narrative diff degrades gracefully to two stacked rendered blocks with the change-summary count above each.
